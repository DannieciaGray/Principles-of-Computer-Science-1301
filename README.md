# Principles of Computer Science 1301
 In this collection, I showcase the various projects and assignments I've completed as part of my journey through the fundamental principles of computer science.

From basic data structures and algorithms to more advanced topics like recursion, sorting, searching, and object-oriented programming, this folder encapsulates the core concepts and practical applications learned during the course. Each project represents a step forward in my understanding of computational thinking and problem-solving skills.

Explore the projects to see how I've applied these principles in real-world scenarios, tackled coding challenges, and demonstrated proficiency in designing efficient solutions. Whether it's implementing a linked list, solving puzzles using dynamic programming, or creating interactive programs, these projects reflect my dedication to mastering the foundations of computer science.

I hope you find inspiration and insights within these projects.
